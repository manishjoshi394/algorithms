# algorithms
This repository contains common algorithms implemented in Java for easy import in projects requiring more than just Java Libraries. I have put all these in one place as a revision repo for myself and others too. 

The aim of the repository is to give a quick collection of optimised and less cluttered Algorithms classes for Java.
Any corrections are always Welcome !

The repository actually consists of my work in implementation of common algorithms as a part of Algorithms Part 1 course on Coursera by Princeton University. I have added assignments done by me to this repo too.
I have not synced any build files of IDE to this repo.

Some dependencies are based on cs.algs4.princeton.edu library (download here - https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar), you can import the package to get the required classes.

This repository has only .java source files which can be easily imported to any IDE.
I have used Netbeans for my purpose.
