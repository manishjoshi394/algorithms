# algorithms
This repository contains common algorithms implemented in Java, Most algos have different implementations. I have put all these in one place as a revision repo for myself and others too.

The repository actually consists of my work in implementation of common algorithms as a part of Algorithms Part 1 course on Coursera by Princeton University. I have added assignments done by me to this repo too.
I have not synced any build files to this repo.
Some dependencies are based on cs.algs4.princeton.edu library, you can import the package at this site to get the required classes.
This repository has only .java source  files which can be easily imported to any IDE.
I have used Netbeans for my purpose.

The work is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and you can find a copy of it in the root directory.
